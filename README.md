# Scalable Approaches for Test Suite Reduction

This repository is a companion page for an ICSE'19 submission. It contains all the material required for replicating our experiments, including: the implementation of the algorithms, the input data, and supplementary tools. 
Some additional results, not included in the paper for the sake of space, are also provided.
